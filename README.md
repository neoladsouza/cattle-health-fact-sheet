# The Effect of Climate Change on Health Conditions of American Cattle
This is a fact sheet that I created as an assignment for AREC280 at the University of Maryland, College Park in Fall 2023.
I used data from the USDA-NASS for cattle health metrics, and I used data from the CRU for temperature and precipitation data for all of the US states.
